                    <h3>Students & Streamers</h3>
                    <p>Our team aims to conduct a stream towards the effects of watching digital series among junior high school students. Our objective is to understand how watching digital series among various streaming platforms helps us to relax and encourage new ideas, and at the same time have a grasp of knowing what is going on around the world. It would also help us discover how screen viewing can affect the way the youth live on a day to day basis.</p>
                    <p><b>Hawk's Goals is to:</b> 
                        a.) Find out how watching digital series across the internet and television affect the academic behavior of junior high school students 
                        b.) Be able to provide better habits and own personal experiences with watching digital series 
                        c.) Learn the good and bad effects of watching digital series </p>
                    <p><b>Hawk's Mission</b> is to be able to provide awareness about the behaviors that we usually tend with when we want to temporarily get away from our academic responsibilities. We want to motivate others that dreads studying without having the process of taking a breather before or after being stressed. And lastly, Hawk aims to investigate if watching digital series has a toll on the academic behavior of junior high school students or otherwise shows a good response due to the pleasure and knowledge it brings.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Our Journey of Finding The Need for Streaming</h1>
                <p>In the first experience guide, we tackled introductions about what exactly is streaming. First of all, we tried watching an example of streaming content. And then we proceeded to identify what the video was about and all of the changes that you can input into it, providing us an introduction on how to use these kinds of streaming platforms. It gave us an overview of how it can be used and how you can change it according to your preferences. We also got the taste of how we can be streamers ourselves and how we can plan our streaming content using the Design Thinking Process that helps us bring innovative solutions to life based on how real users think, feel, and behave. The human centered design process consists of five core stages: empathize, design, ideate, prototype, and test. It gave us the opportunity to brainstorm and carefully plan how exactly we can benefit our viewers and what would satisfy them.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in the second experience guide we conducted basic research towards different streaming platforms. It helped us compare and identify their web interfaces, mobile compatibility, accessibility, navigation, fast load times,  video quality, and sound quality. It helped us grasp new knowledge that will expand our need in streaming and what platform really suits and benefits us. We also tackled javascript operators which are used to perform operations that produce clear results. We used the methods of basic research to perform a detailed guide on how they are used, as we created that guide, we had to think that we were creating that guide for a 5 year old because in that case it will be understandable by any type of audience.</p>
                <p>In the third and fourth experience guide, we learned about comparison and logical operators. What are their differences, the expressions that are considered true or false, and we also created a guide for us to further expand our knowledge regarding the said operators. We also started doing our IPBAâ€™s which was tackling determining the streaming content type, conducting an audience analysis, and finding a need for viewers in a streaming category. In the fifth and sixth experience, we learned about knowing the characteristics of a good stream. And we also created a guide to furthermore understand the use of javascript switch. In the seventh experience guide, which is the last example, we learned how to create our very own website and created a paper that documents how to find a need in the streaming category.</p>

While the Popular live content options include concerts, sporting event, gaming events, the news and local live coverage, and etc. It also allows you to pick the type of contents you want to see. Additionally, we decided to use podcasts as our content since we think podcasts are the best form for delivering our topic and because our survey respondents wanted this for us.</p>
